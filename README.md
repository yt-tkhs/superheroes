## How to Build

First, you need to use Android Studio 4.0.0-beta03 (or higher) to be able to build the app.

### API Key

You need to set followings key-values in `local.properties`.
The values are read at [here](https://github.com/yt-tkhs/superheroes/blob/master/shared/data/build.gradle.kts).

| Key | Value |
|:----|:------|
| `marvel.publicKey` | Public key for the Marvel Comics API  |
| `marvel.privateKey` | Private key for the Marvel Comics API |

Example:

```
marvel.publicKey=<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>
marvel.privateKey=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

If you don't have these keys yet, can get it from [Marvel developer portal](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started).
